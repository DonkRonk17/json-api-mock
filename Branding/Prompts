🧰 JSON‑API‑Mock — Branding Image Prompt Pack
These prompts are ready for any AI image generator and are specifically themed around mock APIs, fake data generation, testing environments, and JSON structures.

🖼️ TITLE CARD (16:9 – GitHub Repository Header)
Prompt — 16:9 Title Card
Create a professional title card for "JSON‑API‑Mock" – a tool that generates mock API responses and structured JSON data for development and testing.

Visual concept: A clean API testing environment with:
- Floating JSON blocks or code cards containing curly braces { } and key:value pairs
- API endpoint bars (GET /api/users, POST /mock/data, etc.) displayed like UI components
- Subtle glowing brackets and data nodes connected by thin lines
- Light holographic grid representing data flow
- A central cube or data packet symbolizing “mock payloads”
- A sense of controlled, synthetic, auto‑generated data

Color scheme: Dark graphite background (#0F0F10) with bright cyan (#00E0FF), green (#00FF99), and violet accents (#B784FF) to highlight JSON and API lines.

Style: Modern dev‑tool aesthetic with smooth digital UI elements. Clean, structured, code‑focused, tech‑professional.

Text: “JSON‑API‑Mock” in bold modern sans‑serif at bottom center.  
Below it in smaller text: “Mock API Responses for Developers”.

Aspect ratio: 16:9, suitable for GitHub repository header.


🟩 LOGO MARK (1:1 Square Icon)
Prompt — 1:1 Logo Icon
Create a square icon logo for the "JSON‑API‑Mock" project.

Visual concept:
- A stylized JSON curly brace pair { } as the central symbol
- A small cube or data packet shape inside the braces
- Subtle dotted‑line API endpoint brackets around the symbol
- A small lightning bolt or spark to represent “instant mock generation”
- Crisp geometries and smooth glow to suggest precision and structure

Color scheme: Nearly black background (#0F0F10) with cyan (#00E0FF) and green (#00FF99) highlights. Optional violet (#B784FF) glow for depth.

Style: Flat‑icon with subtle depth and glow. Clean, technical, recognizable even at favicon sizes.  
Square 1:1 aspect ratio, no text.


🟦 HORIZONTAL LOGO (3:1 Wide Banner)
Prompt — 3:1 Wide Banner
Create a horizontal banner logo for the "JSON‑API‑Mock" tool.

Visual concept:
Left third: A stylized { } JSON brace symbol with the cube/data‑packet from the 1:1 logo, surrounded by thin connecting data lines.  
Right two‑thirds:
- “JSON‑API‑Mock” in bold, modern sans‑serif using a cyan‑to‑white gradient.
- Below: “Mock Data & API Responses for Testing” in smaller, lighter text.
- Gentle flowing lines connecting the JSON symbol to the text, symbolizing data pipelines.

Color scheme: Dark graphite background (#0F0F10) with cyan (#00E0FF), white, and green (#00FF99) highlights. Optional violet (#B784FF) accents.

Style: Clean, modern, highly technical — perfect for a software development tool.  
Aspect ratio: 3:1 (e.g., 1800×600px).
